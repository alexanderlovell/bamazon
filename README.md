BAMAZON

An interactive node app using MySQL and Node.JS allow users to purchase items as a customer, view, track and update the product inventory as a manager, and (in the future) track the total sales by department as a supervisor.


CUSTOMER PORTAL

The Bamazon Customer Portal allows users to view the current items available for purchase. The user will be prompted to enter the item id and quantity they wish to purchase. If the item is in stock, the order will be completed and the user will see the total amount of their purchase.

MANAGER PORTAL

The Bamazon Customer Portal allows users to view and edit the inventory of the store. The user will be prompted to choose from the following options:

1) View products for sale;
2) View low inventory;
3) Add to inventory;
4) Add a new product
